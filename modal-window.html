            Welcome to the Trends in Industrial and Organizational Psychology shiny application. In applied psychology, topics fall in and out of vogue. This app aims to help researchers identify emerging topics as well as topics that could benefit from a fresh perspective. The point and click user interface implements bag-of-words text mining techniques. These methods help identify whether journals are publishing a given topic and whether that topic is being cited more relative to other topics. This information provides insight into where the field has been, where it's at, and where it's going!
