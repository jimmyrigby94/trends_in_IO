Welcome to the Trends in Industrial-Organizational Psychology Shiny web application. In
applied psychology, topics of interest fall in and out of vogue. The present application aims to
help researchers identify emerging trends as well as research topics that are lacking empirical
support or those that might benefit from a fresh perspective. Under the hood of the point-and-
click user interface, the "bag-of-words" text-mining technique helps users identify whether
journals are publishing papers concerning a given topic, and whether and the extent to which
such papers are cited relative to other topics of interest. Taken together, the present application
sheds light on where the field has been, where it is at, and where it is going.
