        Welcome to the Trends in Industrial-Organizational Psychology Shiny web application.  In
        applied psychology, topics of interest tend to fall in and out of vogue.  The present application aims to
        help researchers identify emerging trends and research topics that are lacking empirical
        support or those that might benefit from a fresh perspective.  Under the hood of the point-and-
        click user interface, the "bag-of-words" text-mining technique helps users to identify whether
        journals are publishing papers concerning a given topic, and whether and the extent to which
        such papers are cited relative to other topics of interest.  The database of articles will be updated
        quarterly (i.e., January 1, April 1, July 1, October 1).  In summary, the present application
        sheds light on where the field has been, where it is at, and where it is going.
