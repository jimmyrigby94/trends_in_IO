        Welcome to the Trends in Industrial-Organizational Psychology Shiny web application.  In
        applied psychology, topics of interest tend to fall in and out of vogue.  The present application aims to
        help researchers identify emerging trends and research topics that are lacking empirical
        support or those that might benefit from a fresh perspective.
        <br><br>
        Under the hood of the point-and-click user interface, the "bag-of-words" text-mining technique helps
        users to identify whether journals are publishing papers concerning a given topic, and whether
        and the extent to which such papers are cited relative to other topics of interest.  Refresh automation 
        is currently being updated after migrating from a scraping solution from SCOPUS to semantic scholar's API. 
        More to come on the refresh cadence. 
        
        <br><br>
        In summary, the present application sheds light on where the field has been, where it is at,
        and where it is going.
